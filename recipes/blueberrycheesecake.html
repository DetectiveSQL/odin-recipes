                <li>1 ½ cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla essence</li>
                <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
                <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
                <li>2-3 tbsp water</li>
                <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Directions</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>To begin with, line an 8-inch springform pan with butter paper. Crush the digestive biscuits in a bowl and add melted butter and sugar. Mix well and press this mixture evenly onto the bottom of the pan. Refrigerate it for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Now, add the cream cheese to a bowl and whisk it until it becomes smooth. Once done, add sugar and vanilla, and whisk again. In a separate bowl, whisk the heavy cream until frothy and then gently fold it into the cream cheese mixture.</li>
                <li>Mix well and spread evenly over the chilled biscuit base. To prepare the blueberry topping, add fresh blueberries along with lemon juice, cornflour, sugar, and water to a pan set on a low flame.</li>
                <li>Allow it to simmer for a few minutes. Once done, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool.</li>
                <li>Top the cheesecake with the prepared blueberry topping and set it in the refrigerator for 4 to 5 hours, or ideally overnight. Remove from the pan, slice, and enjoy your delicious no-bake blueberry cheesecake.</li>
